# Progress bot (DiscordJS)

A simple bot to track progress towards numeric goals. Just use `!track <item> <value>` to create a tracked item, and then add your progress by using `!add <item> <amount to add to the progress>`.

# Other Commands

`!check <item>` checks an item progress
`!delete <item>` stop tracking and removes that item from db
`!deduct <item> <amount to deduct from progress>` deducts from the current progress.

# How to install and run

Create a new application at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ and then turn it into a bot application.

Take your bot token from the discord page and change it at config.json in your project folder.

After that, just run the app with `node index.js` and you should be good to go!

To invite your own bot to your server edit this url with your client id provided at the discord dev site https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<your_client_id>&scope=bot
